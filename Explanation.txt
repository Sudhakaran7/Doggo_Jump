Dora, your dog is going to participate in a 'Best Doggo' Competition,
it crossed all rounds, so it selected for final round,
In final round, dora have to jump on the given boxes
Given a list of boxes' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine dora is able to jump to last stone. Initially, 
dora is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.
If dora last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. Note that dora can only jump in the forward direction.
Find whether it can jump to last box.

Sample input:
0 1 2 3 5 8

Sample Output:
True

Explanation:
initially dora will start from 0,
0 -> 1 (1 unit of jump)
1 -> 2 (1 unit of jump)
2 -> 3 (1 unit of jump)
3 -> 5 (2 unit of jump)
5 -> 8 (3 unit of jump)
So the output is True

Sampe input:
0 1 3 5 9 11

Sample Output:
False

Explanation:
initially dora will start from 0,
0 -> 1 (1 unit of jump)
1 -> 3 (2 unit of jump)
3 -> 5 (2 unit of jump)
5 -> 9 which cannot be jumped because it cannot jump 4 units, it can only jump 3 units (last jump was 2 units, so it can jump 2+1 units=3 units)
so the output is False.
